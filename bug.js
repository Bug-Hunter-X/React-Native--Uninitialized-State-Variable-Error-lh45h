This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been fully initialized. This is common in asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API, where the state update might happen after the component renders.  Here's an example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    //Error here if data is accessed before fetch completes
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.name}</Text> {/*Potentially accessing data before it is set*/}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
